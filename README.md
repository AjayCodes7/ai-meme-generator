# **Project Description**
The AI Meme Generation project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision
to automatically generate humorous memes. Users can input a prompt or context, and the system
uses GPT-based models for cap􀆟on generation and image models (like Stable Diffusion or DALL·E) to
generate or select suitable images. The goal is to automate meme crea􀆟on using advanced AI,
targe􀆟ng content creation efficiency and creativity.
